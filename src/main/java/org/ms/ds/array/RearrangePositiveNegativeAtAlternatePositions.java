Q : https://www.techiedelight.com/rearrange-array-positive-negative-numbers-alternate-positions/
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MeI5Kk8KTQ

here 2 type of questions can be asked
1. just rearrange the element negative and positive alternatively (without preserving order)
logic : first segregate all positive and negative then start two pointer once from start and other
from end. then increase/ decrease both by 2 and swap the ele if nt on correct position.
2. rearrange the element negative and positive alternatively (with preserving order)
even position sud have positive number
odd position sud have negative number
if not instead of swapping the element just rotate by 1 once we find right value for that place so order will be preserved
